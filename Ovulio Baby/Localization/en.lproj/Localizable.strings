Myth 1: Having sex or deep penetration while you’re pregnant will harm the baby. This is a common fear that many new expecting couples have, it’s natural to wonder if this myth holds any truth and thankfully, it really doesn’t. The vagina is designed to stretch during sex, this creates a little gap between your vagina and the cervix. If your partner is packing serious length, an added fact to put your mind at ease is that the cervix is closed and wrapped in a mucus plug to protect your baby.

Myth 2: Sex can induce labor. Ah yes, another common misconception, we are very happy to report that this is simply not true, this myth came about simply because semen contains prostaglandin, which is the same hormone that is used at hospital to induce labor. This is given to woman in a highly concentrate synthetic form. So, the good news is, men simply don’t create enough of this hormone to cause their partner to go into an untimely labor.

Myth 3: Your baby knows what you’re up to. It may freak some coupes out to be sexually intimate out of the sheer terror that their baby will know what is going on. Rest assured, your baby doesn’t have a cooking clue what you’re getting up to, we promise. Yes, your baby can detect noises and movement while you’re pregnant, but your little one cannot comprehend or interpret what is happening.

Sex during pregnancy can create a deep, intimate connection in your relationship. Not only will it benefit your relationship, but it can even bring you more pleasure, let’s take a look at just a few facts that are sure to excite you:

Fact 1: It’s easier to orgasm when you’re pregnant! Yes, you read that right. Women gain around 3 more pounds of blood, making the occurrence of orgasms easier and more frequent.

Fact 2: Goodbye birth control! Yes, obviously there is no need for birth control while pregnant and this is great news for those who know the various side effects of the pill and other forms of contraceptives.

Fact 3: Orgasms can ease your discomfort. Back pain and headaches are common when you’re pregnant, lucky for you, your body has your back! When you orgasm, your body releases the wonderous hormone called oxytocin which can ease pain.";

Here are some positions that are ideal for an expecting couple:

● Spooning: The spooning position can be deeply intimate, not only are you in a cuddling position, but allows you to lie on your side, supporting your belly.
● Classic cowgirl: This position accommodates your belly and doesn’t put any unnecessary pressure on it. It puts you in control of the speed and depth according to your comfort.
● The edge of the bed. Lying on the edge of the bed while your partner stands to penetrate you, this allows your legs to open more, and the angle avoids belly contact.
● From behind: Pop a pillow down to give your tummy extra support and go to town! Just note, this may not be advised in the late stages of pregnancy as this position provides deep penetration.

Instead, continue to lay down for around 15 minutes, try your best to stay still so that those swimmers get to where they’re going. You can also help the sperm out by placing a pillow underneath the hips, giving gravity the upper hand.

There is no guarantee that these tips work 100% of the time, however you’re most definitely giving the sperm their greatest shot at achieving their life’s purpose, getting you pregnant!
Tip #2: Have an orgasm! It is said that having an orgasm can increase your chances of conception due to the uterine contraction during climax. This theory has mixed results, yet it is worth experimenting with. Oxytocin is released during orgasm, and this is a feelgood hormone, removing some of that stress, which is one of conception’s worst enemies! And hey, even if this theory is not entirely rock solid, who doesn’t want an orgasm anyway?
Tip #3: Ditch the lube. There is some debate on if lubrication hinders conception, yet many people recommend ditching the lubrication in the process, as it’s believed to affect the mobility of sperm.";

He theorized ‘The Shettles Method’ which supported the notion that ‘boy sperm’ was weaker, smaller, and faster than ‘girl sperm’. Deep penetration is believed to allow the ‘boy sperm’ a head start as they will be deposited close to the cervix, so that those fast little guys beat the ‘girl sperm’ to the egg.

Positions for Deep Penetration
● Doggy style: Doggy style enables deep penetration, just be sure to turn over so that you keep those swimmers on the right side of gravity.
● Standing up: Now, this one is a little more of a wives tale, but it is said that standing up allows for deeper penetration and could promote the conception of a baby boy.
● Straddling: Riding cowgirl is a great deep penetration position; one you can control.

A Little Tip:
Another popular theory when attempting to conceive a boy, is increasing your intake of calories. A study conducted with 740 women concluded that women who increased their calorie intake had a higher chance of falling pregnant with a boy.

This method also recommends shallow penetration based on the same theory that ‘girl sperm’ will outlive the ‘boy sperm’ and endure the long journey to the egg.

Positions for Shallow Penetration
● Spooning: Spooning is a position that is perfect for shallow penetration to occur, by closing your legs while spooning, this can also reduce deep penetration.
● Side by side: Lying side by side with legs intertwined will promote shallow penetration.
● Missionary: The women should lay flat, with her legs in the missionary position, be sure not to lift or wrap your legs around your partner as this will allow for deeper penetration.

A Little Tip:

As the two of you experience this challenging, but amazing, time in your life together you will become closer than ever before but also face emotional challenges you have never dealt with previously. Listen to their concerns and try to help ease their minds as best you can. If your partner becomes upset listen to what they are saying and try to resolve the issue as quickly and calmly as possible.  Make relevant suggestions when needed but try not to come off as bossy. Hormones tend to create quite a mess of emotions and can turn to anger very quickly. Try to remember that this isn't your partner usually and that the hormones are controlling a lot of their mood swings right now. Think of it like an amped-up PMS. Yes. It gets that bad sometimes and over the smallest of things. Not all pregnancies have unpredictable mood swings throughout but usually experience them at some point in the pregnancy at least once or twice. Even if they are thrilled to be expecting, they may also be scared, nervous, or uncertain about things, especially if this is their first pregnancy. Worrying if one will be a good parent is one of the biggest stressors during pregnancy. Reassure your partner that they will be the very best parent and once the baby comes things will settle down for them. Be their sounding board. Encourage them to share their thoughts and feelings with you. Ask them how they are feeling and what they think about different topics and situations so that they know you are taking an active role in the pregnancy. They need to know that you are available to them and feel secure that you care.

Listen to their concerns, feelings, and hopes. Letting them know you are there and acknowledging them gives them the support they need when they need it the most. They are very vulnerable right now and need to know you can be strong for both of you.
Give them caring massages to ease their stress and aches. Pregnancy not only puts a toll on the mind but the body as well. Easing those sore aching muscles and joints might be just the ticket to letting them know you are going the extra mile to show you care.
Pregnancy can make us feel extra tired, especially in the first and third trimester. Try helping out more with chores around the house like doing the laundry, cooking, and running errands to give them some much-needed rest. Making a human is hard work!
Cravings for certain foods can hit when we least expect them. So if your partner has been nibbling on something specific try stocking up on those items so they can have them whenever they want. There's nothing better than satisfying a craving for a pickle and some ice cream at 3 am!
Sometimes pregnancy will result in some bedrest unexpectedly. For those suffering from boredom, some entertainment would be nice. Try finding some of their favorite things like movies, books, and magazines to keep them busy. Crocheting and knitting are also a nice idea. Word search and crossword books are a common go-to.";

Many couples get caught up with the baby planning and pregnancy and forget to focus on one another. Planning a babymoon might be a good idea before the new addition makes its grand entrance.

"LearningResourceArticleVC.hitTheGym.section2.text" = "Walking and fertility yoga are two of the best ways to promote circulation and improve the strength and flexibility of the muscles surrounding the uterus. Leading an inactive lifestyle with little to no exercise can create a situation of stagnation of blood flow to the uterus and other reproductive organs. The main artery that supplies blood to our legs also supplies blood to our uterus, ovaries, and vagina — so basically, keep moving! If you have a desk job, you may find yourself sitting around a lot, causing the blood flow to the uterus to be compromised. This won’t help any, especially if you already have other fertility issues. What’s more, is that not moving this area of our body enough can contribute to scar tissue and adhesions forming. A sedentary lifestyle also contributes directly to weak muscles in the uterus. If you’re trying to conceive, adding a brisk walk to your daily routine may help, but you may want to hold off training for that marathon. Brisk walking, leisurely cycling, golfing, and gardening are considered moderate exercise. If you’re overweight, moderate exercise is especially important as being overweight impacts your fertility negatively. If you’re not accustomed to working out at all, start slowly and work your way up. Most women who are already active should be able to continue to exercise without worrying that it will negatively impact their fertility. Women who exercise to relieve stress should certainly not stop when they want to become pregnant unless there is a medical reason for doing so. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends 30 minutes or more of moderate exercise per day on most if not all days of the week unless you have a medical or obstetric complication. The optimal Body Mass Index (BMI) for fertility for women is between 20 and 25.";

"LearningResourceArticleVC.hitTheGym.section3.text" = "The same rules generally apply to men, but intense exercise has been found to decrease testosterone levels, which in turn reduce sex drive and sperm health. The three biggest concerns for men are heat, pressure, and trauma. Sperm production requires a temperature between 94 and 96 degrees Fahrenheit. Even a one-degree increase is enough to stop production and kill off any sperm already produced. So it’s best to try to avoid vigorous exercise that will put pressure on your testes or cause you to overeat. When you do exercise, try to avoid wearing jock straps, getting in hot tubs and steam rooms. And if you just can’t avoid it, limit time to 15 minutes. A few suggestions on “safe” exercises for men while protecting fertility and boosting sperm count include jogging around the block long enough to get an accelerated heartbeat, swimming (this allows plenty of moderate exercise while keeping the ‘boys’ cool and comfy), and yoga or pilates — which are both harder than they look! Men should not exceed 45 minutes of exercise a day for the health and mobility of sperm and sperm count. The same rules on obesity apply to men, although their recommended BMI shouldn’t be lower than 18 for optimal fertility.";

Exercise, eating healthy, and regular visits with your primary care physician are very important as well as any OBGYN appointments that are needed. Routine screenings and fertility checkups are highly recommended. When in doubt, have it checked out. If you think it is taking you a bit too long to get pregnant, talk to your doctor about this and they may recommend you see a specialist for more in-depth testing and screenings. Most of all, don't forget to have fun trying. Don't put too much stress on you or your partner mentally about how long it's taking, what could or might go wrong, or worry about what will happen once you are pregnant. Have fun!";

As with many painful experiences in life, perhaps the best we can take from our sorrows is what we learn by moving through them. You will never forget the pregnancy or your baby, nor should you.

When a person loses their chance at parenthood, there is no universally understood etiquette for how to respond. On the contrary, miscarriage is typically shrouded in silence. Expressing your sympathy and your grief about a miscarriage can go a long way to helping your partner feel comforted and less alone.

Having a C-Section birth will impact your post-pregnancy sex life as well. A Cesarean section is a major surgery and takes time to heal and recover.

A number of fears may stick in your mind and put you off having sex after childbirth. Fear that stitches will tear, that it’ll hurt, that you’ll no longer be attractive to your partner are all very common! Talking to your partner about your anxieties will help to reduce them. Make time for caressing and other forms of pleasure and intimacy rather than penetration until you feel confident and ready for sex.";

Ease yourself slowly out of this phase in order to give your child the opportunity to become independent. You also need time to let your partner in and not feel excluded. It’s important to carve out some time for yourselves as a couple (as difficult as this may be).

3. Download games and apps for couples. Apps that allow you both to explore new positions, complete sexy challenges and give you that extra inspiration can be so much fun! We recommend downloading the Scratch Adventure app! Couples can discover newfound kinks and live out their sensual fantasies.
4. Write it out! Try writing out some kinky things you’ve always wanted to try on separate pieces of paper, put them in a bowl and grab one when you’re in the mood. Think of this like a couples bucket list, you could also opt to not tell each other what you’re writing to build the excitement and curiosity.
5. Sexy texts. Sexting brings an element of anticipation to your sex life. Send nudes and dirty texts while you’re apart, give them something to think about.
6. Toys. These days, there are an infinite number of toys available for couples to try! Toys add a little something extra to your lovemaking and are built for pleasure.
7. Get away for a while. Take a short break from the day-to-day hustle and enjoy some away time with your lover.

Our approach integrates time-tested techniques, inspired by comprehensive reproductive research, along with contemporary scientific data.

Timing and Ovulation Cycle: A key element in our methodology involves understanding the ovulation cycle and timing intercourse. Studies suggest that timing intercourse closer to the ovulation date may influence the gender of the baby. This is based on the characteristics of different sperm types and their varying speeds and longevity.

Dietary Considerations: Emerging research points towards the potential impact of diet on influencing baby gender. Specific dietary patterns and nutrient intakes might be associated with the probability of conceiving a male or female child, though these findings are still under continuous study and not conclusively proven.

Hormonal Influence: Hormonal levels and their fluctuations in potential parents are also considered as a possible factor. The hormonal environment at the time of conception might play a role in determining the gender of the baby.

Lifestyle Factors: Lifestyle factors such as stress levels, physical activity, and overall health may also have an indirect influence on baby gender, as they affect general fertility and reproductive health.

It's important to note that while these methods are grounded in scientific research, they do not guarantee a specific outcome. Human biology and reproductive processes are complex, and many factors contribute to the determination of a baby's gender. We encourage our users to approach these methods as part of a broader understanding of reproductive health and family planning.

References to Scientific Studies: Our methodology is continually updated in line with ongoing reproductive health research. We reference a wide range of studies from reputable medical journals and institutions to ensure our users receive well-rounded and scientifically sound advice.

We at Ovulio Baby are committed to empowering our users with knowledge and tools for their reproductive journey, always prioritizing health, well-being, and informed choice. \n\n";

It's important to note that lying flat on your back for extended periods should be avoided once you reach 20 weeks of pregnancy and beyond, as it can become uncomfortable. If needed, try performing this pose while sitting on a chair instead. Hold the stretch for about 5 to 10 breaths on each side.";

Stress and anxiety can disrupt hormonal balance, making conception more challenging. That's why, in this section, you'll find Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) sessions—designed to help you release tension, calm your mind, and create the ideal conditions for pregnancy.

PMR works by systematically tensing and relaxing different muscle groups, which helps lower cortisol levels, improve circulation, and enhance overall well-being. This not only reduces stress and anxiety but also promotes better sleep, emotional balance, and a more receptive state for conception.

Take a deep breath, unwind, and let your body find its natural rhythm with Ovulio Baby.";
